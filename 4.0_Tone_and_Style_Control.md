# 4 - Tone and Style Control

## The Technique
Tone and Style Control is a crucial skill that demonstrates the ability to tailor AI-generated content to specific audiences and communication channels. This involves commanding the AI to convey the same core information using vastly different voices, language, and formatting to achieve a specific strategic goal.

## The Scenario
A successful new video game, "Game X," is experiencing unexpected server strain due to overwhelming popularity. A critical, unscheduled server maintenance is required in the middle of the night. We need to communicate this same event to three completely different audiences.

## The Process and Final Outputs

### The Prompt

The following single prompt was used, containing three distinct, numbered tasks. Each task defined a unique persona, audience, tone, and set of required details.

> **Prompt Design:**
>
> 1.  **Write an internal memo to the engineering team** in a direct, technical, and urgent tone. Their task is to perform critical server maintenance because the current server cluster cannot handle the load from the unexpected success of "Game X." They need to stabilize the current user experience immediately and then perform a full-scale upgrade during a planned midnight outage. The style should be concise and professional, fitting for an engineering team.
>
> 2.  **Write a formal announcement to our enterprise partners (Ubisoft, Microsoft)** in a professional, reassuring, and apologetic tone. Inform them of the same emergency maintenance. Frame the issue positively as a "happy miscalculation"‚Äîwe projected 1 million users in the first week but surpassed our 2 million user capacity in just five days. Reassure them that this upgrade will ensure long-term stability and a superior user experience.
>
> 3.  **Write a casual post for our public-facing social media (X, Facebook, YouTube)** in a simple, human, and transparent tone. Explain that the servers are at max capacity (2 million players!). Assure current players their experience will be smooth until midnight, when the game will go down for the upgrade. Announce that **all players** (both existing and those who couldn't get in) will receive **10,000 Diamonds** as a thank you. The style should be easy to understand with a strong emphasis on the free Diamonds.

### Resulting Outputs

Here are the three distinct outputs generated from the single, multi-part prompt.

---

#### **Output 1: Internal Memo to the Engineering Team**

**(Tone: Direct, Technical, Urgent)**

**SUBJECT: URGENT - All Hands on Deck for "Game X" Server Cluster Upgrade - EOD**

**Team,**

We have a critical situation with the "Game X" production servers. Due to massive, unexpected user influx post-launch, the primary cluster is redlining and cannot handle the current load.

**Immediate Priority (Now until Midnight):**
Your immediate task is load stabilization. We need all available hands to ensure the current active user base maintains a smooth, uninterrupted experience. No new user sign-ins will be permitted until the upgrade is complete.

**Action Item (Midnight - 04:00 UTC):**
At midnight, we will initiate a full maintenance outage. The primary objective is to migrate to the new, high-capacity server cluster we had slated for Q4. This timeline has been moved up to tonight. Full deployment and testing must be completed within the 4-hour maintenance window.

This is our top priority. All other sprint tasks are on hold until this is resolved. Let's sync up on Slack in 15 minutes to delegate roles.

#### **Output 2: Formal Announcement to Enterprise Partners**

**(Tone: Professional, Reassuring, Apologetic)**

**Subject: Important Update Regarding "Game X" Server Infrastructure and Scheduled Maintenance**

Dear Partners at Ubisoft and Microsoft,

This notice is to inform you of an emergency server maintenance we will be conducting on our title, "Game X," scheduled for midnight tonight. We sincerely apologize for the short notice and any inconvenience this may cause.

The need for this maintenance stems from a truly unprecedented and positive response to the game's launch. Our initial projections estimated approximately 1 million users within the first week. However, in just five days, we have surpassed our maximum server capacity of over 2 million concurrent players‚Äîa happy miscalculation on our part, and a testament to the incredible market reception.

To ensure the long-term stability and provide the best possible player experience, we are expediting a significant infrastructure upgrade that was originally planned for a later date. This maintenance will resolve all current capacity issues and fortify the platform for future growth.

We are confident that this proactive step will result in a more robust and reliable service for the millions of players enjoying "Game X" on your platforms.

Thank you for your understanding and continued partnership.

Sincerely,

The [Your Company Name] Team
