# 0.0 - The Master Workflow & Core Methodologies

## 1. Introduction & Purpose
This document outlines a systematic, multi-step workflow designed to guide a Generative AI through complex, single-threaded, iterative development tasks while ensuring process integrity, quality control, and the creation of a detailed, transparent log for documentation.

The core principle is to abandon the idea of a single, complex "master prompt" in favor of a **human-directed sequence of simple, single-purpose prompts**. This workflow utilizes "temporary personas," a "Dual Output" system, and a piecemeal approach to neutralize the AI's inherent "Final Synthesis Bias," placing the user in the role of the "Director" at every stage.

## 2. The Master Workflow: A Framework for Iterative Tasks

This section details the primary, step-by-step workflow for executing and documenting iterative, single-threaded tasks like Chain of Density.

### 2.1. When to Use This Workflow
This is a specialist's framework for deep, rigorous work. It is a powerful tool, but it is not a one-size-fits-all solution for every AI interaction. The decision to apply the full workflow should be a deliberate, strategic choice made by the user based on the nature of the task.

*   **Ideal Use Cases (High Suitability):** This workflow is perfectly suited for tasks that are inherently **sequential, iterative, and require a high degree of logical consistency and a transparent audit trail.**
    *   **Chain of Density (CoD):** The quintessential use case.
    *   **Prompt Chaining:** Each step in the chain can be treated as a stage in the workflow.
    *   **Red Teaming:** Perfect for documenting the hypothesis, experiment, and analysis of AI flaws.
    *   **5-Step Prompt Framework:** Excellent for demonstrating the refinement from an unstructured to a structured prompt.

*   **Scalable Use Cases (Moderate Suitability):** For highly branching and complex frameworks, the Master Workflow can be used in a "zoomed-in" or scalable manner.
    *   **Tree of Thoughts (ToT):** Applying the full workflow to every node is inefficient. However, it is an invaluable tool for "deep diving" into the most critical or complex nodes of a tree to ensure they are developed with the highest possible quality.

*   **Unsuitable Use Cases (Low Suitability):** This workflow is not the right tool for simple, non-iterative, or purely parallel tasks.
    *   **Meta-Prompting:** A simple `Question -> Answer` interaction that does not require an iterative loop.
    *   **Tone and Style Control:** A parallel generation task where the goal is to create multiple outputs from a single input, not to iterate upon a single output.

### 2.2. The Workflow Steps
The user (the "Director") initiates and manages each step of the cycle for each stage of the project.

**Step 1: The Content Generation Prompt**
This is the primary creative/factual step.

*   **Action:** The Director writes a detailed prompt to generate a new piece of content or iterate on a previous one.
*   **Best Practices:** Label the prompt clearly (e.g., `Prompt - Stage X`).

**Step 2: The "Dual Output" Generation**
The AI executes the task and provides the content in two distinct formats to ensure perfect documentation.

*   **Action 1 (Raw Output):** The AI first generates the "raw" content as requested.
*   **Action 2 (Markdown Output):** The AI then immediately provides the **exact same text** from Action 1, but fully wrapped in the final, copy-paste-ready markdown formatting.

**Step 3: The Prompt Critique Cycle (Static Template)**
The Director audits their own prompt design against universal principles.

*   **Action:** A temporary "Prompt Engineer" persona is summoned using a static, reusable template.

**Static Prompt Template for Prompt Critique:**
> `Critique - Stage [Number] (Prompt Analysis)`
>
> "Adopt the persona of a prompt engineer specializing in the technique being used. Your task is to critique **only the format, structure, and principles** of the prompt I designed in Step 1 of this stage, provided below inside ` ``` `. Do not critique the creative/factual content. This persona is for this request only. Provide feedback in a structured format."
>
> \```
> [Paste the full prompt text here]
> \```

**Step 4: The "Gold Standard" Output Critique Cycle (Dynamic Template)**
The Director audits the AI's generated content using a dynamic, AI-assisted approach.

*   **Action:** A two-part meta-prompt is used to first generate the correct critique criteria, and then immediately perform the critique.
*   **Rule of Application:** This criteria generation step is performed **once per distinct task**.

**Dynamic Meta-Prompt Template for "Gold Standard" Output Critique:**
> `Critique - Stage [Number] (Output Analysis)`
>
> **Part 1 (Criteria Generation):** "You are an expert in prompt engineering. I am about to ask for a critique of a piece of AI-generated content. The content is a **[Brief, 1-sentence description of the content, e.g., 'a scene in a hard sci-fi story']**. First, generate a bulleted list of the **specific, task-oriented critique criteria** that should be used to evaluate this type of content."
>
> **Part 2 (Critique Execution):** "Now, in the same response, adopt the persona of an expert **[Your Topic Expert, e.g., sci-fi writer]**. Use the exact criteria you just generated to provide a structured critique of the content provided below inside ` ``` `. This persona is for this request only."
>
> \```
> [Paste the full output text from Step 2 here]
> \```

**Step 5: The Refined Prompt & Output (The "Show Your Work" Step)**
This step demonstrates a commitment to process improvement.

*   **Action:** The **Director (the human user)** synthesizes the feedback from the critique cycles to manually write a new, surgically improved prompt. This prompt is then executed to generate a superior output for the same stage (repeating Steps 1 and 2 with the refined content).

**Step 6: Process Guidance & The Next Iteration**
Throughout the workflow, the AI is also tasked with a meta-role.

*   **AI as "Process Partner":** After each step is complete, the AI provides a brief "Process Guidance" note, stating the logical next step in the Master Workflow.
*   **The Loop Repeats:** The Director takes the final, refined output and uses it as the foundation for the prompt for the next stage.

## 3. Specialized Tools & Methodologies

This section details specific, reusable meta-prompts and methodologies that can be used to initiate or support complex AI tasks.

### 3.1. "Link Zero": The Strategic Planning Prompt for Prompt Chaining

**The Technique:** For complex, multi-step projects that will be executed using Prompt Chaining, it is highly effective to use a "Link Zero" meta-prompt. This is a strategic, upfront step where the AI is commanded to act as a domain-specific expert and propose several different, logical "chains" or roadmaps for the user to choose from. This ensures the project begins with a clear, well-defined, and strategically sound plan.

**Universal Meta-Prompt Template for "Link Zero":**
> **Your Goal:** [Clearly and concisely describe your final desired outcome. e.g., "I need to create a comprehensive marketing launch plan for a new product."]
>
> **Context:**
> *   **Topic/Product:** [Provide the specific subject matter.]
> *   **Audience:** [Who is the final product for?]
> *   **Key Constraints:** [Any other important rules.]
>
> **Your Task:**
> Adopt the persona of an **"Expert Strategist."** However, if this persona is not the most appropriate for the specific goal I've provided, your first action must be to recommend a more suitable, domain-specific expert persona (e.g., "Marketing Strategist," "Executive Producer").
>
> Then, using the most appropriate persona, decompose the overall goal into **2-3 distinct strategic approaches**. For each approach, present it as a logical, sequential **"Prompt Chain,"** with each step labeled as "Link 1," "Link 2," etc.
>
> For each link in the chain, provide a brief description of its specific objective. The goal is for me to be able to use these chains as a roadmap for my subsequent prompts.

### 3.2. The AI Agent Framework: The Principle of Procedural Instruction

**The Technique:** An AI Agent is a conceptual framework where the AI is given a goal, a set of instructions, and a clear stop condition to autonomously carry out a defined, interactive task. A key insight from practical application is that a successful agent is not defined by general guidelines, but by a clear **procedural algorithm** embedded within the setup prompt.

**The Principle of Procedural Instruction:**
The reliability of an AI Agent is directly proportional to the procedural clarity of its instructions. Instead of giving the AI a general goal (e.g., "Help me prepare for an interview"), a robust agent prompt defines a specific, sequential **interaction loop**. This transforms the AI from a conversational partner into a predictable, step-by-step tool.

The framework consists of two separate commands: a "Setup Prompt" to initiate the loop, and a "Wrap-Up Prompt" to synthesize the results.

**Universal "Setup Prompt" Template for AI Agents:**

> **Persona:**
> Act as a [specific role or expert persona, e.g., "Senior Hiring Manager at Google"].
>
> **Context:**
> Hereâ€™s the situation: [describe your goals, background, or scenario, e.g., "I am a recent graduate preparing for a behavioral interview..."].
>
> **Interaction Loop (The Procedural Algorithm):**
> *   You will [describe the first action, e.g., 'ask me a common behavioral interview question'].
> *   You will then **WAIT** for my response.
> *   After I provide my answer, you will [describe the second action, e.g., 'provide constructive feedback on my response using the STAR method'].
> *   You will repeat this loop [number of times, e.g., 'for a total of three questions'].
> *   Maintain a [tone/style: professional, encouraging, direct] tone throughout.
>
> **Stop Condition:**
> Our interaction will conclude only when I write the exact phrase: **"[chosen stop phrase]"**. Do not end the session or provide a summary until you see this phrase.
>
> **Start:**
> Please begin now by [the first action you want the AI to take, e.g., 'introducing yourself and asking your first question'].

---

**Universal "Wrap-Up Prompt" Template:**
*(This prompt is used only after the interaction has been terminated by the stop phrase.)*

> **Task:**
> Now, please provide a final summary of our entire interaction.
>
> **Format:**
> Structure your summary with the following headings:
> *   **Key Advice/Suggestions Given:** A bulleted list of the main points.
> *   **Identified Areas for Improvement:** The user's key weaknesses or next steps.
> *   **Helpful Resources:** Any relevant external resources, vocabulary, or checklists.
