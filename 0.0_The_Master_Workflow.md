# 0.0 - The Master Workflow: A Framework for Complex Iterative AI Tasks

## 1. Introduction & Purpose
This document outlines a systematic, multi-step workflow designed to guide a Generative AI through complex, single-threaded, iterative development tasks (like Chain of Density) where process integrity, quality control, and detailed documentation are paramount.

The core principle is to abandon the idea of a single, complex "master prompt" in favor of a **human-directed sequence of simple, single-purpose prompts**. This workflow utilizes "temporary personas," a "Dual Output" system, and a piecemeal approach to neutralize the AI's inherent "Final Synthesis Bias," placing the user in the role of the "Director" at every stage.

### 1.1. When to Use This Workflow
This is a specialist's tool for deep, rigorous work. It is not a one-size-fits-all solution for every AI interaction.

*   **Ideal Use Cases:** Chain of Density, developing a single, complex piece of text (e.g., a report chapter, a legal document), or any task requiring a high degree of logical consistency and a transparent, auditable development history.
*   **Less Suitable Use Cases:** Simpler, non-iterative tasks (e.g., Tone & Style Control) or highly branching, exploratory tasks (e.g., Tree of Thoughts), where applying this level of rigor to every step would be inefficient. It can, however, be used to "zoom in" and develop a particularly complex node within a ToT process.

## 2. The Workflow Steps

The user (the "Director") initiates and manages each step of the cycle for each stage of the project.

### Step 2.1: The Content Generation Prompt
This is the primary creative/factual step.

*   **Action:** The Director writes a detailed prompt to generate a new piece of content or iterate on a previous one.
*   **Best Practices:** Label the prompt clearly (e.g., `Prompt - Stage X`).

---

### Step 2.2: The "Dual Output" Generation
The AI executes the task and provides the content in two distinct formats to ensure perfect documentation.

*   **Action 1 (Raw Output):** The AI first generates the "raw" content as requested.
*   **Action 2 (Markdown Output):** The AI then immediately provides the **exact same text** from Action 1, but fully wrapped in the final, copy-paste-ready markdown formatting.

---

### Step 2.3: The Prompt Critique Cycle (Static Template)
The Director audits their own prompt design against universal principles.

*   **Action:** A temporary "Prompt Engineer" persona is summoned using a static, reusable template.

**Static Prompt Template for Prompt Critique:**
> `Critique - Stage [Number] (Prompt Analysis)`
>
> "Adopt the persona of a prompt engineer specializing in the technique being used. Your task is to critique **only the format, structure, and principles** of the prompt I designed in Step 2.1, provided below inside ` ``` `. Do not critique the creative/factual content. This persona is for this request only. Provide feedback in a structured format."

### Step 2.4: The "Gold Standard" Output Critique Cycle (Dynamic Template)
The Director audits the AI's generated content using a dynamic, AI-assisted approach.

*   **Action:** A two-part meta-prompt is used to first generate the correct critique criteria, and then immediately perform the critique.
*   **Rule of Application:** This criteria generation step is performed **once per distinct task**. If a project involves writing five narrative scenes, the criteria are generated for the first scene and then reused for the next four. If the project then pivots to writing a technical document, the criteria generation is run again for that new task.

**Dynamic Meta-Prompt Template for "Gold Standard" Output Critique:**
> `Critique - Stage [Number] (Output Analysis)`
>
> **Part 1 (Criteria Generation):** "You are an expert in prompt engineering. I am about to ask for a critique of a piece of AI-generated content. The content is a **[Brief, 1-sentence description of the content, e.g., 'a scene in a hard sci-fi story']**. First, generate a bulleted list of the **specific, task-oriented critique criteria** that should be used to evaluate this type of content."
>
> **Part 2 (Critique Execution):** "Now, in the same response, adopt the persona of an expert **[Your Topic Expert, e.g., sci-fi writer]**. Use the exact criteria you just generated to provide a structured critique of the content provided below inside ` ``` `. This persona is for this request only."
>
> ```

> ```

### Step 2.5: The Refined Prompt & Output (The "Show Your Work" Step)
This step demonstrates a commitment to process improvement and is crucial for a comprehensive portfolio piece.

*   **Action:** The **Director (the human user)** synthesizes the feedback from the critique cycles to manually write a new, surgically improved prompt. This prompt is then executed to generate a superior output for the same stage (repeating Steps 2.1 and 2.2 with the refined content).

---

### Step 2.6: Process Guidance & The Next Iteration
Throughout the workflow, the AI is also tasked with a meta-role.

*   **AI as "Process Partner":** After each step is complete, the AI provides a brief "Process Guidance" note, stating the logical next step in the Master Workflow.
*   **The Loop Repeats:** The Director takes the final, refined output and uses it as the foundation for the prompt for the next stage.
