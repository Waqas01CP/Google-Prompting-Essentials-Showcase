### **"Link Zero": The Strategic Planning Prompt**

**Your Goal:** [Clearly and concisely describe your final desired outcome. e.g., "I need to create a comprehensive marketing launch plan for a new product."]

**Context:**
*   **Topic/Product:** [Provide the specific subject matter.]
*   **Audience:** [Who is the final product for?]
*   **Key Constraints:** [Any other important rules.]

**Your Task:**
Adopt the persona of an **"Expert Strategist."** However, if this persona is not the most appropriate for the specific goal I've provided, your first action must be to recommend a more suitable, domain-specific expert persona (e.g., "Marketing Strategist," "Executive Producer").

Then, using the most appropriate persona, decompose the overall goal into **2-3 distinct strategic approaches**. For each approach, present it as a logical, sequential **"Prompt Chain,"** with each step labeled as "Link 1," "Link 2," etc.

For each link in the chain, provide a brief description of its specific objective. The goal is for me to be able to use these chains as a roadmap for my subsequent prompts.
