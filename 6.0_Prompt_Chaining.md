### **"Link Zero": The Strategic Planning Prompt**

**Your Goal:** [Clearly and concisely describe your final desired outcome. e.g., "I need to create a comprehensive marketing launch plan for a new product."]

**Context:**
*   **Topic/Product:** [Provide the specific subject matter.]
*   **Audience:** [Who is the final product for?]
*   **Key Constraints:** [Any other important rules.]

**Your Task:**
Adopt the persona of an **"Expert Strategist."** However, if this persona is not the most appropriate for the specific goal I've provided, your first action must be to recommend a more suitable, domain-specific expert persona (e.g., "Marketing Strategist," "Executive Producer").

Then, using the most appropriate persona, decompose the overall goal into **2-3 distinct strategic approaches**. For each approach, present it as a logical, sequential **"Prompt Chain,"** with each step labeled as "Link 1," "Link 2," etc.

For each link in the chain, provide a brief description of its specific objective. The goal is for me to be able to use these chains as a roadmap for my subsequent prompts.


# 6.0 - Prompt Chaining: A Demonstration

## The Technique
Prompt Chaining, also known as decomposition, is a powerful strategy for tackling large, complex tasks. Instead of asking the AI to perform a massive task in a single, overwhelming prompt, the user breaks the task down into a logical sequence of smaller, more manageable sub-tasks ("links"). Each link in the chain builds upon the output of the previous one, giving the user greater control and resulting in a higher-quality and more structured final product.

## The Scenario
A comprehensive marketing launch plan will be created for a fictional, high-end product: the "Aeterna Mug," a premium, self-heating travel mug. This demonstration will begin with a "Link Zero" meta-prompt, where the AI is tasked with proposing several strategic roadmaps (the chains) for the project.

## The Process: Decomposing the Goal

### **"Link Zero": The Strategic Planning Prompt**
The process begins not by executing a task, but by commanding the AI to act as a strategist and propose several different, logical "chains" or roadmaps for the user to choose from. This meta-prompt ensures the project starts with a clear and well-defined plan.

**Prompt Design (Link Zero):**
> `Prompt - Link Zero:`
>
> **My Goal:** I need to create a comprehensive marketing launch plan for a new product.
>
> **Context:**
> *   **Product Name:** Aeterna Mug
> *   **Concept:** A premium, self-heating, temperature-controlled travel mug made from ceramic-coated stainless steel.
> *   **Market Position:** A high-end, "buy it for life" product competing in a crowded market against brands like Ember and Yeti.
> *   **Target Audience:** Tech-savvy professionals and discerning coffee/tea enthusiasts.
>
> **Your Task:**
> Adopt the persona of an **"Expert Strategist."** However, if this persona is not the most appropriate for the specific goal I've provided, your first action must be to recommend a more suitable, domain-specific expert persona.

**Resulting Output (Link Zero):**

**Persona Recommendation:** For the goal of creating a comprehensive marketing launch plan, the persona of an **"Expert Marketing Strategist"** is more suitable than a general "Expert Strategist." I will proceed using this more appropriate persona.

***

### **Approach A: The "Persona-First" Strategy**
*(This approach focuses on deeply understanding the customer first and building the entire launch around their specific needs, desires, and communication channels.)*

*   **Prompt Chain:**
    *   **Link 1: Define Target Audience Personas.**
        *   **Objective:** To create 3-4 detailed customer personas, including their demographics, pain points (e.g., "my coffee gets cold during my commute"), and media consumption habits (e.g., "listens to tech podcasts, reads Forbes").
    *   **Link 2: Develop Core Messaging & Value Propositions.**
        *   **Objective:** To craft specific marketing messages that resonate with each persona, highlighting how the Aeterna Mug solves their unique problems (e.g., for the "Busy Executive," focus on reliability; for the "Coffee Aficionado," focus on precise temperature control).
    *   **Link 3: Brainstorm Content & Channel Strategy.**
        *   **Objective:** To generate a list of targeted content ideas (e.g., a blog post titled "The Last Travel Mug You'll Ever Buy," a YouTube review collaboration with a tech influencer) and the best channels to reach each persona.
    *   **Link 4: Draft Key Launch Assets.**
        *   **Objective:** To write the first draft of a critical launch asset, such as the announcement email to the pre-launch list or the script for a short, targeted social media ad.

### **Approach B: The "Product-First" (Competitive Differentiation) Strategy**
*(This approach focuses on establishing the Aeterna Mug's unique place in a crowded market by highlighting its superior features and quality against competitors.)*

*   **Prompt Chain:**
    *   **Link 1: Conduct a Competitive Analysis.**
        *   **Objective:** To create a feature-by-feature comparison chart of the Aeterna Mug against its main competitors (Ember, Yeti), identifying its key differentiators (e.g., longer battery life, superior ceramic coating, lifetime warranty).
    *   **Link 2: Define the Unique Selling Proposition (USP).**
        *   **Objective:** To synthesize the competitive analysis into a single, powerful Unique Selling Proposition—a clear, concise statement that defines why the Aeterna Mug is the superior choice.
    *   **Link 3: Create a Feature-Benefit Marketing Copy.**
        *   **Objective:** To write compelling marketing copy for the product's website, translating each key feature (e.g., "ceramic-coated interior") into a tangible customer benefit (e.g., "no metallic taste, just the pure flavor of your coffee").
    *   **Link 4: Design a Pre-Launch "Teaser" Campaign.**
        *   **Objective:** To brainstorm ideas for a "teaser" campaign that builds hype by hinting at the product's superior features without revealing the full product (e.g., social media posts asking, "What if your coffee could stay the perfect temperature for 4 hours, not just 1?").

### **Approach C: The "Lifestyle & Brand" (Aspirational) Strategy**
*(This approach focuses less on the product's technical features and more on building an aspirational brand around the *idea* of the Aeterna Mug—a symbol of quality, permanence, and mindful ritual.)*

*   **Prompt Chain:**
    *   **Link 1: Establish the Brand Identity & Voice.**
        *   **Objective:** To define the core attributes of the Aeterna brand (e.g., "sophisticated," "durable," "mindful," "premium") and the tone of voice to be used in all communications.
    *   **Link 2: Develop a Visual Mood Board Concept.**
        *   **Objective:** To generate a detailed description of a visual "mood board" for the product's photography and videography, focusing on lifestyle imagery (e.g., "a quiet morning on a misty balcony," "a focused deep-work session in a minimalist office").
    *   **Link 3: Write the "Our Story" Narrative.**
        *   **Objective:** To create a compelling brand narrative for the "About Us" page, telling the story of why the Aeterna Mug was created (e.g., "a rebellion against a throwaway culture").
    *   **Link 4: Draft an Influencer Partnership Brief.**
        *   **Objective:** To write a brief for collaborating with lifestyle influencers who align with the brand's values, focusing on authentic storytelling rather than simple product reviews.

### **Link 1: Define Target Audience Personas**
The first link in our chosen chain is to establish a deep understanding of the ideal customers for the "Aeterna Mug." The prompt was designed to provide the AI with three distinct, pre-defined personas, which the AI would then formalize and structure as the foundational output for this link.

**Prompt Design (Link 1):**
> `Prompt - Link 1:`
>
> **1st customer persona: The Skeptical Professional**
> *   **Demographics:** The customer's name is Josh and he is 58 years old. He is a lawyer and lives in LA, commutes by car, and has a high disposable income.
> *   **Pain Points:** Josh's main problem is that his coffee gets cold while commuting. He feels frustrated that his coffee does not remain hot for longer periods. He has tried more than 10 different mugs, but they did not keep his coffee hot for an extended time.
> *   **Media Consumption:** Josh usually uses LinkedIn and X. He does not follow influencers but does watch YouTube and listens to a radio station while commuting.
>
> **2nd customer persona: The Analytical Engineer**
> *   **Demographics:** The customer's name is Albert and he is 35 years old. He is a software engineer in California with an above-average income.
> *   **Pain Points:** Albert's main point is that he spills coffee on his laptops quite a lot and requires coffee throughout the day. Durability is also required since his previous mugs broke a lot, and he feels angry because the cups do not live up to their reputation.
> *   **Media Consumption:** He uses LinkedIn, X, and YouTube. He follows some software gurus and has software newsletter subscriptions.
>
> **3rd customer persona: The Social Professional**
> *   **Demographics:** The customer's name is Betty and she is 29 years old. She is a realtor and event organizer in LA. She commutes by car and has a high earning portfolio.
> *   **Pain Points:** Betty's main issue is that she requires an aesthetic mug that is also easy to take around. She usually leaves her mug while showing houses as she feels embarrassed because of their designs, and she needs her coffee to stay active. Previous mugs only fulfilled one of her two conditions.
> *   **Media Consumption:** She uses Instagram, TikTok, and X for her jobs, listens to podcasts in commute, and constantly checks a specific website for house updates as a realtor.
