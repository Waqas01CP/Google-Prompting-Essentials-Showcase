# AI Prompt Engineering Portfolio: A Practical Showcase

This repository serves as a practical demonstration of the principles taught in **Google's Prompting Essentials specialization on Coursera**. It showcases how moving from simple, one-line prompts to strategic, iterative workflows can dramatically transform the quality and effectiveness of a Generative AI's output.

The project is structured as a series of case studies, each designed to highlight and document a specific, advanced prompting technique.

### Methodology & Tools
*   **AI Model:** All outputs were generated using **Google's Gemini model**.
*   **Process:** The core methodology involves iterative refinement, decomposition, and strategic querying to guide the AI toward a high-quality, targeted result. It's important to note that results from generative models can vary, but the principles demonstrated here are consistent.

### Author's Note on Collaboration and Methodology
It is crucial to understand the dynamic of this project. The insights, strategic direction, critical questions, and the very design of the advanced workflows (such as the Master Workflow) originated from the **human user (the author)**. The role of the AI was that of a sophisticated, collaborative tool—an instrument that was expertly played.

This portfolio is not a showcase of what an AI can do on its own; it is a demonstration of how a skilled operator **guides, directs, and corrects** an AI to produce a high-quality result, proving that the user's expertise is the most critical component in any advanced AI-powered project.

### Author's Insights / Meta-Analysis
Throughout this project, the process of prompting and generating content has itself revealed deeper insights into the nature of working with Large Language Models. This section highlights key meta-learnings.

**On the Persistence of Bias in AI Models:**
A critical line of inquiry in this project addressed the paradox of AI bias. While this model is highly aligned for safety and designed to refuse to act on harmful biases, its foundational training data is a reflection of the internet—a vast corpus of human text containing inherent and unavoidable prejudices.

The alignment process, which uses techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), is a powerful tool for teaching the AI to recognize and avoid exhibiting these biases. However, this process is not perfect. It is subject to the limitations and potential unconscious biases of the human reviewers themselves.

The key insight is that **no large language model can be considered 100% unbiased.** While major, overt forms of bias are heavily trained against, more subtle, nuanced, or culturally specific "residual biases" can and do persist. Therefore, a skilled AI operator must maintain a critical mindset, understanding that the AI is a tool that can describe and analyze the concept of bias from an objective standpoint, but it should not be treated as a perfectly neutral oracle. The "Simulated Failure" methodology used in the Red Teaming demonstration is a direct acknowledgment of this limitation.

*(This section will be expanded with a full list of meta-learnings at the conclusion of the project.)*
