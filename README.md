# Google-Prompting-Essentials-Showcase
A practical portfolio demonstrating advanced prompt engineering techniques from Google's specialization, including meta-prompting, Tree of Thoughts, and a toolkit of core methodologies.

# AI Prompt Engineering Portfolio: A Practical Showcase

This repository serves as a practical demonstration of the principles taught in **Google's Prompting Essentials specialization on Coursera**. The goal is to illustrate the tangible difference in AI-generated output when moving from a simple, novice-level prompt to a strategic, context-rich prompt crafted by a skilled user.

This project is structured as a series of case studies, each designed to highlight specific, advanced prompting techniques and showcase their real-world application.

### Methodology & Tools
*   **AI Model:** All outputs were generated using **Google's Gemini model**.
*   **Process:** The core methodology involves iterative refinement, prompt chaining, and strategic querying to guide the AI toward a high-quality, targeted result. It's important to note that results from generative models can vary, but the principles demonstrated here are consistent.
